# Overview

We have a list (Array) of 1001 Javascript maps (Objects), that have been pulled down from the internet somewhere.  This data can be found in `data.txt`.  We'd like to give an interface to our users to do the following:

1. Display a list of the data to the end user, in a table-like format
2. Have the user enter a value into a search box, and have the data filter in the list if it partially matches on any of the properties
3. Give the user the ability to sort the data *by one column only* (ie there is no requirement to chain the sorts).  These columns should be `title`, `id`, `year`

Since there is lots of data in the list, the user is going to need to be able to paginate through the items.  The user should be able to select the page size from a dropdown - the options being 10, 25 and 50; and with the default value being 10.

## Tools  
React  
Redux

**Bonus Points**  
Reselect  
Immutable

The project uses both of these packages, so it is highly encouraged that if you are familiar with them to try it.  If you are creating custom selectors, here is a helpful gist that is pulled straight from the project:

There is 0 requirement for styling in this challenge.  If you'd like to pretty it up with bootstrap or something then by all means, but you will not be judged on this at all.

A wireframe has been provided for reference if you need it, but you are in no way required to follow that layout.

## Additional Stuff

 - Depending on how you do this, there might be some pauses/freezes as you do the sorting.  This isn't a test of optimisation, its purely to see how you work with the toolsets.  If you want to go super fancy and dispatch the sorting out to `WebWorkers` feel free, but its not a requirement.

 - If you're across Python and want to mess with the data (or regenerate it), you can pipe the output from `stdout` right to a text file in any shell: `python ./data.py > data2.txt`.  You'll need `pipenv` to build the environment.
